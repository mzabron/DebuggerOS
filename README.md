# DebuggerOS

This game was created in just 24 hours during the HackYeah 2025 hackathon, under the Gamedev category.  
Since the theme focused on horror, we took a playful twist: a *terminal-simulator game* which is already terrifying enough for some non-programmers.

The experience mixes traditional command-line navigation with fast, arcade-style interactions, while the “system” slowly becomes stranger, glitchier, and increasingly unsettling. Players explore a simulated file system, run commands, and piece together clues as the world starts behaving in ways it shouldn’t sometimes even breaking the fourth wall.

## Features
* **Narrative-Driven Gameplay:** Uncover the dark history of “DebuggerOS” through hidden text logs, exploring the stories of past users.
* **Terminal Simulation:** Use real commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, and `gcc` to navigate directories, read files, and execute programs.
* **Puzzle Solving:** Decipher clues hidden in file contents to find passwords and unlock secured directories.
* **Custom Shell Interpreter:** A fully functional command-line parser that mimics real-world text-based operating systems.
* **Virtual File System:** Explore a simulated directory tree containing mock user data, hidden text files, and system executables.
* **Procedural Animation:** Glitchy text effects, typewriter rendering.
* **Dynamic Spawning System:** An intelligent wave-based system with escalating difficulty.
